  <section id="About">
    <h2>About</h2>
      <p> Hello and welcome to my Portfolio! I'm excited for what's to come as we continue to learn more about HTML and CSS for webpage development with the Code The Dream Program. I grew interested in coding after seeing videos and hearing more about it from a family member who currently codes. After talking, she introduced me to several different resources and programs to look into and CTD happened to be one of them! Even though, I didn't have any knowledge or background in coding whatsoever, I still wanted to pursue the path of learning to code to test my learning abilities and to gain a new skill set that I could apply to the real world or future job. I'm currently working as a Pharmacy Technician at Duke Hopsital in Perioperative Services and while working full-time and doing classes can be challenging, I perserve through it because I want to better my life and future career. I beleieve joining a program like CTD can help with part of that by introducing me to the knowledge and skills needed to pursue a potential career in computer programming/coding! </p>
