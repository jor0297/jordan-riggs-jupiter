    <h2>About</h2>
      <p> Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio! I'm excited for what's to come as we continue to learn more about HTML and beyond with the Code The Dream Program. I grew interested in coding after seeing videos and hearing more about it from a family member who currently codes. After talking, she introduced me to several different resources and programs to look into and CTD happened to be one of them! Even though, I didn't have any knowledge or background in coding whatsoever, I still wanted to pursue the path of learning to code to test my learning abilities and to gain a new skill set that I could apply to the real world or future job. I'm currently working as a Pharmacy Technician at Duke Hopsital in Perioperative Services and while working full-time and doing classes can be challenging, I perserve through it because I want to better my life and future career. I beleieve joining a program like CTD can help with part of that by introducing me to the knowledge and skills needed to pursue a potential career in computer programming/coding. </p>
